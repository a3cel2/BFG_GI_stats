The gene involved in the highest number of differential interactions was RAD5, which participates in 252 differential interactions, 49 of which involve a sign reversal.  Out of 49 sign-reversed differential interactions with RAD5, 42 involve MUS81, MMS5, RAD51, RAD54, or RAD55.  MUS81 and MMS4 encode a heterodimer which cleaves nicked intermediates in recombinational DNA repair [22645308], while RAD51 binds ssDNA to facilitate homologous recombination, and requires RAD54 and RAD55 for its activity [12887906].  All RAD5 interactions with these genes are positive in MMS and 4NQO, and either negative or neutral in other conditions (Figure XX).
